* Strong and statically typed
-- What is that?
--- strong means type of the variable can not change over time
when we declare a variable a to hold an integer , its always going to hold an integer.
--- statically means, all of those variable have to be defined at compile time.

##key feature
* simplicity
* fast compile time
* garbage collected (manages its own memory)
* compile to stand alone binaries
