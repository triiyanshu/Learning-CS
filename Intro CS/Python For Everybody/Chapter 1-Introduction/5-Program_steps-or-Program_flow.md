* Like a recipe or installation instructions, a program is a sequence of steps to e done in order.
* some steps are **conditional** - They may be skipped.
* sometimes a step or group of steps is to be **repeated**.
* sometimes we store a set of steps tp be used over and over as needed several places throughout the program.

### example sequential steps:

``` 
x = 2 
```
&darr;
```
print(x)
```
&rarr; output &rarr; **2**
```
x=x+2
```
&darr;
```
print(x)
```
&rarr; outpur &rarr; **4**
