interactive python is good for experiments and programs in 3-4 lines long.

Most programs are much longer, so we type them in to a file and tell python to run the commands in the file

in a sense, we are giving python a script

as a convention, we add " .py" as the suffix on the end of these files to indicate they contain python.
