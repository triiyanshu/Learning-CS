A **variable** is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the variable "name".

Programmer can choose the names of the variable

You can change the contents of a variable in the later statement.

##Python variable name rules
* must start with a letter or underscore _
* Must consist of letters, numbers, and underscores
case sensitive

##Mnemonic Variable Names
* Since we programmers are given a choice in how we choose our variable names, there is a bit of " best practice"
* We name variables to help us remember what we intend to store them ( **mnemonic** = memory aid)
